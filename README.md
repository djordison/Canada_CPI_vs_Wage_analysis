# Canada_CPI_vs_Wage_analysis

> Analysis of Canadian consumer cost vs wage growth using numerical and visual Seaborn methods.

- Issues

No evaluation of different geographic regions. 
Could not find clean method to label multiple lines directly in matplotlib or Seaborn.

- Data

Data pulled from government of Canada sources on median and average wages as well as official CPI and sub-item costs. Normalized to 1997 = 100. Sub-items evaluated for essential vs non-essential by author.

- Potential further work

Analysis of comparable American data
